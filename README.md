## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Students in New York face several challenges when navigating the CUNY and SUNY systems:

- **Scattered Information**: Details about professors and courses are spread across multiple platforms
- **Outdated Data**: Official websites often contain outdated or incomplete professor information
- **Time-Consuming Research**: Students waste hours trying to find reliable professor reviews and course details
- **Decision Paralysis**: With so many options across 60+ campuses, students struggle to make informed decisions

This AI-powered solution brings all this information together in one place, providing students with reliable, up-to-date information they can trust.

## 🚀 Features

- **Professor Search**: Find comprehensive information about professors using their first name, last name, and college/university
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Get detailed, contextual information about teaching styles, course difficulty, and more
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **User Consent Management**: Privacy-first approach with clear consent management
- **Source Attribution**: All information comes with clearly marked sources so students know what to trust

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React 18 with TypeScript
  - Vite as build tool
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - React Router for navigation
  - Lucide icons
  - React Markdown for rendering formatted responses

- **Backend**: 
  - FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
  - Uvicorn as ASGI server

## 🔄 How It Works

The system uses a multi-agent AI architecture to provide the most accurate and helpful information:

1. **User Query Processing**: Analyzes what you're asking to route to the right specialized agent
2. **Data Retrieval**: Pulls information from multiple sources:
   - Curated database of professor information
   - Official school websites and resources
   - Trusted third-party review platforms
   - Real-time web search when needed
3. **AI-Enhanced Responses**: Synthesizes this information into clear, helpful answers
4. **Source Attribution**: Every piece of information includes its source so you can verify and trust what you're seeing

## 🧠 Backend Architecture

The backend is built with a focus on performance, scalability, and AI-first design, implementing:

- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for different types of queries (professor info, transfer details, etc.)
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For accurate, up-to-date information with reduced hallucinations
- **Vector Database**: For semantic search across the knowledge base
- **Memory Systems**: To maintain context in conversations
- **Real-time Web Integration**: To supplement internal knowledge with the latest information

The backend API is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and the source code is available at [CampusMind-Backend Repository](https://github.com/slfagrouche/CampusMind-Backend).
